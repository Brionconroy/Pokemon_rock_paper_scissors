# Pokemon Battle

Pokemon battle game is a twist on a Rock, Paper, Scissors. The Pokemon battle game has come from the TV series Pokemon where different types of Pokemon have leverage over each other. Fire beats grass, grass beats water, and so on. I thought this might be a good idea for a themed rock, paper, scissors game. The pokemon Battle game lets you play agianst the computer and pick from three different types of pokemons. 

## User Experience (UX)

As a new visitor to the site, I want to be able to quickly and simply understand what the site does and the rules of the game. As a returning user to the site i want to quickly navigate to the game without interruptions.

## Design (UXD)

The User Experience Design was constructed using the five planes.

+ Stretagy: Is this content relevant to the user and is it culturally appropriate?
+ Scope: Are we accomplishing our goals of broadcasting the product?
+ Structure: How many pages should we have in our website and why?
+ Skeleton: Does the structure of the wireframe meet the costumer's/user's needs? Is the web page responsive?
+ Surface: Does the site look good visually? Does it have enough images and colours?

## Features id like top add in the fututer

+ I would like to add an Easter egg where a Pikachu image comes onto the screen and shocks everyone and the game resets to 0.
+ I would also like to add a log-in for the user to make it more interactive. A User name would come up in place of user selection. 

## Bugs

One bug I came across was my user choice was not appearing when selected. This was because I had used and ID selector and not a class selector.
