# Pokemon Battle

Pokemon battle game is a twist on a Rock, paper, Scissors. The Pokemon battle game has come from the TV series Pokemon where differant types of Pokemon have leaverage over there other. fire beats grass, grass beat water and so on. i thought this might be a good idea for a themed rock, paper, scissors game. The pokemon Battle game lets you play agianst the computer and pick from three differnt types of pokemons. 

## User Experience (UX)

As a new visitor to the site, I want to be able to quickly and simply understand what the site does and the rules of the game. As a returning user to the site i want to quickly navagate to the game without interutions.

## Design (UXD)

The User Experience Design was constructed using the five planes.

Stratagy: Is this content relvent to the user and is it culturally appropriate?
Scope: Are we accomplishing our goals of broadcasting the product?
Structure: How many pages should we have in our website and why?
Skeleton: Does the structure of the wireframe meet the costumers/users needs? Is the web page responsive?
Surface: Does the site look good visully? Does it have enough images and colours?
